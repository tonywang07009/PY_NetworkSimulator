  List every `shortcut:` comment (and older `ponytail:` ones) as a debt ledger. One-shot report,

  shortcuts", /ponytail-debt.
---

Every deliberate ponytail shortcut is marked with a `shortcut:` comment naming
its ceiling and upgrade path (older code may say `ponytail:`). This collects them into one ledger so a deferral
can't quietly become permanent.

In workflow change review, use
[the technical debt contract](../workflow/references/technical-debt.md) to
reconcile findings with OpenSpec tech_improve.md. That authorized operation may
persist the register without another approval; standalone queries stay read-only.
Use docs/output.md for human explanations and decision questions, resolved through
[workflow project context](../workflow/references/project-context.md#resource-locations).

## Scan

Grep the repo for comment markers, skipping `.git` and everything the
`.gitignore` files ignore (dependencies, build output, caches, in any stack):

`git grep --no-index --exclude-standard -nE '(#|//|/[*]) ?(shortcut|ponytail):'`  (add other comment prefixes if your stack uses them)

If the user names their own marker word (`/ponytail-debt TODO`), grep for that word instead.

Each hit is one ledger row. The comment prefix keeps prose that merely mentions
the convention out of the ledger. Skip hits that are not a deferral, like a note
about a keyboard shortcut.

## Output

One row per marker, grouped by file:

`<file>:<line>, <what was simplified>. ceiling: <the limit named>. upgrade: <the trigger to revisit>.`

The convention is `shortcut: <ceiling>, <upgrade path>`, so pull the ceiling
and the trigger straight from the comment. Want an owner per row too? add
`git blame -L<line>,<line>`.

Flag the rot risk: any marker comment that names no upgrade path or
trigger gets a `no-trigger` tag, those are the ones that silently rot.

End with `<N> markers, <M> with no trigger.` Nothing found: `No marked shortcut debt found.`
An empty marker scan does not establish that the code has no technical debt.

## Boundaries

Standalone use reads and reports only. Persist a standalone report only when
requested; workflow uses the authorized register contract above, not a second
PONYTAIL-DEBT.md copy. A report does not authorize unrelated code cleanup.
